> version 1.0 (released scheduled for 01/08/2003) <

Changes (since):

build #64 - RC3

- Added a VM version check, VM`s lower than 1.4 won`t be accepted and an error is thrown.
- The auto-updater now knows what file (le or pro) to get from the update server.
- Fixed the build.xml script for ant. 
- Build in checks for program parts that only work on MySQL.
- Fixed a bug while receiving indexes on MSSQLServer.

build #63 - RC2

- New directory structure for the application.
- Fixed a bug in loading the classpath libraries, use a URI for filepaths now!
- Added LicenseKey tool!
- Added VIEW`s to table overview.
- Export data ignores binary files from now on.
- Created a DynamicLoader class which add jar libraries to the classpath at runtime. By default all the jars in the lib dir are included in the classpath now, this solves the third-party jdbc driver problems.
- Fixed a little bug in the ConnectionProfileUI, when deleting the last profile the textfields where never cleared.
- The main window now uses as default size the maximumscreenbounds, no more resizing of the main window when starting eSQLManager.
- Fixed bug: advanced table data edit opened if a cell of a new row was selected.
- Added a new splashscreen, the splash class now adds all information to the splashscreen.
- Added documentation to the help files.
- FieldProperties and create table are now consistent with each other. Changed the signed in FieldProperties to unsigned. By default all numbers are signed, see documentation in the help.
- Fixed problems with error handling in Import + Export interfaces. When import or export fails during the process a message is displayed why it failed.
- Smashed a bug in the indexes interface, unique was never set if an index is unique, fulltext can`t be set via JDBC driver, need to find a solution for this problem.
- Added status messages to inform the user what esqlmanager is doing.
- Drop table and drop database now remove the data tab in the ConnectionWindowUI.
- Edit table now works for all table properties (name, comment, type) except for the tablecolumns.
- Create table doesn`t allow indexes or keys to be defined anymore, need to create a table first and then add indexes with the indexes manager.

build #61 - beta

- Finished the index manager, eSQLManager Pro is now beta status! Only bugs will be fixed until the 1.0 release.
- dbcreator uses esql.domain.DataType, removed esqlcreator_sql.xml
- Removed confirmation message from connectionwindow when no connection to a server could be made.
- Syntax documents and query window now use the syntax.xml for sql keywords.
- Removed more old Java files which were no longer needed.
- Changed the datatypes.xml file and improved the working of the loading of the datatypes in the ServerType class.
- Changed the connectionprofile startup sequence, now first the profiles are loaded before showing them.
- Implemented the new DatabaseDriver class. All JDBC driver settings can now be managed with an UI. The driver.xml file contains al settings needed.

build #60

- Cleaned up the project, removed some old java files.
- Added some new keywords to sql.syn
- Using JDom beta 9 as of now!
- Fixed some layout issues in preferences, import/export and fieldproperties interfaces.
- Changed connection profile behavior: when the profiles.xml file couldn`t be used for whatever reason, the complet program became unusable because the profile manager could not be started. Now when the profiles.xml file isn`t available the profile manager will still be working but without profiles.
- Fixed a bug in the connection profile. When after deleting a profile the save button was pressed the deleted item reappeared.
