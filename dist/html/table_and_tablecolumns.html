			<b>Signed and Unsigned integers</b><br>
			<br>
			An integer is a number with no fractional part; it can be positive, negative or zero. In ordinary usage, one uses a minus sign to designate a negative integer. However, a computer can only store information in bits, which can only have the values zero or one. We might expect, therefore, that the storage of negative integers in a computer might require some special technique. It is for that reason that we began this section with a discussion of unsigned integers.
			<br><br>
			As you might imagine, an unsigned integer is either positive or zero. Given our discussion in the previous sections about binary numbers, it might seem that there is little more to say about unsigned integers. In fact, there is essentially only one thing, and that is one of the most important things that you will learn in this text. Consider a single digit decimal number: in a single decimal digit, you can write a number between 0 and 9. In two decimal digits, you can write a number between 0 and 99, and so on. Since nine is equivalent to 10 1 - 1, 99 is equivalent to 10 2 - 1, etc., in n decimal digits, you can write a number between 0 and 10 n - 1. Analogously, in the binary number system,
